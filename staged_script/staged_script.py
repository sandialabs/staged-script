class StagedScript:
    """
    The base class for all staged scripts.

    This serves as a base class for any Python scripts intended to drive
    a series of commands in the underlying shell.  It's built around the
    fundamental concept of a "stage", in that such scripts are typically
    broken down into stages, each of which consists of a handful of
    commands.  Certain actions are performed at the beginning or end of
    any given stage, and it's also possible for stages to be skipped or
    retried.  The class also provides a means of producing a script
    execution summary to show the user exactly what was done, for the
    sake of replicability and easing debugging.

    Attributes:
        args (Namespace):  The parsed command line arguments for the
            script.
        commands_executed (List[str]):  The commands that were executed
            in the shell.
        console (Console):  Used to print rich text to the console.
        current_stage (str):  The name of the stage being run.
        dry_run (bool):  If ``True``, don't actually run the command
            that would be executed in the shell; instead just print it
            out.
        durations (List[StageDuration]):  A mapping from stage names to
            how long it took for each to run.  This is implemented as a
            ``list`` of named tuples instead of as a ``dict`` to allow
            the flexibility for stages to be run multiple times.
        print_commands (bool):  Whether to print the commands executed
            immediately before executing them.
        retry_arg_group (argparse._ArgumentGroup):  A container within
            the :class:`ArgumentParser` holding all the arguments
            associated with retrying stages.
        script_name (str):  The name of the script (the
            :class:`StagedScript` subclass) being run.
        script_stem (str):  Same as :attr:`script_name`, but without the
            extension.
        script_success (bool):  Subclass developers can toggle this
            attribute to indicate whether the script has succeeded.
        stage_start_time (datetime):  The time at which a stage began.
        stages (Set[str]):  The stages registered for an instantiation
            of a :class:`StagedScript` subclass, which are used to
            automatically populate pieces of the
            :class:`ArgumentParser`.  This may be a subset of all the
            stages defined in the subclass.
        stages_to_run (Set[str]):  Which stages to run, as specified by
            the user via the command line arguments.
        start_time (datetime):  The time at which this object was
            initialized.

    Note that additional attributes are automatically generated for each
    ``stage`` registered for a subclass object:

    ``STAGE_NAME_retry_attempts`` (int)
        The number of times to attempt retrying the ``STAGE_NAME``
        stage.
    ``STAGE_NAME_retry_attempts_arg`` (argparse.Action)
        The corresponding argument in the :class:`ArgumentParser`, so
        subclass developers can modify it if needed.
    ``STAGE_NAME_retry_delay`` (float)
        How long to wait (in seconds) before attempting to retry the
        ``STAGE_NAME`` stage.
    ``STAGE_NAME_retry_delay_arg`` (argparse.Action)
        The corresponding argument in the :class:`ArgumentParser`, so
        subclass developers can modify it if needed.
    ``STAGE_NAME_retry_timeout`` (int)
        How long to wait (in seconds) before giving up on retrying the
        ``STAGE_NAME`` stage.
    ``STAGE_NAME_retry_timeout_arg`` (argparse.Action)
        The corresponding argument in the :class:`ArgumentParser`, so
        subclass developers can modify it if needed.

        Convert a method to a stage.

        A decorator to take a function and convert it to a conceptual
        stage of a script.  Each stage consists of the following phases:

        Pre-Stage Actions
            A series of commands to run before a stage technically
            begins.  See :func:`_run_pre_stage_actions`.
        Begin-Stage Actions
            A series of commands to run at the beginning of the stage.
            See :func:`_begin_stage`.
        Stage Body
            The actual work of the stage itself, encapsulated in the
            decorated function.  However, if a particular stage is not
            to be executed (if it's not passed in with the ``--stage``
            flag on the command line), then there's also the concept of
            **Skip-Stage Actions**, which are a series of commands to
            run if a stage is to be skipped.  See :func:`_skip_stage`.
        End-Stage Actions
            A series of commands to run at the end of the stage, even if
            an exception was raised within the **Stage Body**.  See
            :func:`_end_stage`.
        Post-Stage Actions
            A series of commands to run after a stage has technically
            wrapped up.  See :func:`_run_post_stage_actions`.

        If a subclass developer writes a function to be wrapped by this
        decorator such that it raises a :class:`RetryStage` exception on
        certain failure conditions, then there are additional
        **Prepare-to-Retry Actions**, which are a series of commands to
        run before the next attempt at running the stage (see
        :func:`_prepare_to_retry_stage`).  The **Begin-Stage Actions**,
        **Stage Body**, and **End-Stage Actions** are wrapped in this
        retry loop, while the **Pre-** and **Post-Stage Actions** are
        not.

        If the retry specifications (see :func:`parser`) are exhausted
        and the wrapped function still raises a :class:`RetryStage`
        exception, then there is a **Retry Error Handler** containing a
        series of commands to run when exiting the retry loop (see
        :func:`_handle_stage_retry_error`).

        Args:
            stage_name:  The name of the stage, which must consist of
                only lowercase letters.  Note that stage names must be
                unique within a class that inherits from
                :class:`StagedScript`.

                happen in the stage.

        The formatter class defaults to a combination of

        defaults to all the stages registered when the subclass was
        instantiated.

        Similarly, if you wish to override the default values for the
        retry arguments that are automatically provided for every stage,
        you can do so with, e.g.:

        .. code-block:: python

        If you wish to suppress the stage retry arguments for your
        stages that don't raise a :class:`RetryStage` exception, you can
        do so with, e.g.:

        .. code-block:: python
